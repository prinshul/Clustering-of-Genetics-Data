# Clustering-of-Genetics-Data
Human Genome Diversity Project, a large collection of genomes from around the world  Build a model to cluster human individuals into groups based on genetic information. Genetic data can be represented as vectors of 0s, 1s, and 2s for each individual. 2 indicates the individual has two copies of the reference allele. 0 indicates the individual has inherited two copies of the alternate allele and 1 indicates the individual inherited an alternate allele from one parent and a reference allele from the other.  Genotype data X where xnm is the genotype of individual n at marker m. N = 172 individuals (from 8 different sub-populations) at M = 64 markers.  Likelihood for data is a Binomial distribution Unknown parameters are cluster memberships for the individuals, Z; a vector of length N taking values 1, 2, ., K and cluster specific frequencies at each marker, F; a K Ã— M matrix of values that lie between 0 and 1. Flat categorical and beta priors are assumed. Perform Bayesian inference on the cluster memberships of each individual and on the frequency of mutations within each cluster at each marker. Sample from posterior for Z and F Use Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to find best K Implemented in JAGS/R
